# Gnusto Engine

- Gnusto enables faithful translations of the original ZIL-based interactive fiction classics, accurately replicating the original gameplay mechanics and stories
- It provides a clean, elegant and ergonomic foundation for creating new works of interactive fiction
- It adheres to the highest standards of software craftsmanship, with clean, SOLID, modular, maintainable code
- All of Gnusto's code is well-tested, with 80-90% coverage
- It is easy customize and extend ANY and ALL of the built-in functionality
- It utilizes modern Swift standards, features and optimizations under the hood
- `Docs/References/Zork 1` is ALWAYS the definitive reference for ZIL behavior

## Foundational Rules

- When adding, modifying or reviewing functionality, ALWAYS refer to the original ZIL source code in `Docs/References`
  - Use `Docs/References/Cloak of Darkness` to quickly learn the fundamentals of how some functionality was handled in ZIL
  - Use `Docs/References/Zork 1` for the canonical mechanics and phrases, e.g. "It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue."
  - Nostalgia is the heart of the Gnusto engine, so ALWAYS honor the past by using phrases and response from the classics
  - Use `Docs/References/Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy` to study more advanced puzzles and techniques
  - Use `Docs/References/A Mind Forever Voyaging` to study the later state of the art in the classical era of ZIL programming
- ALWAYS provide comprehensive tests when adding or modifying functionality
- NEVER move on to the next task without providing comprehensive tests
