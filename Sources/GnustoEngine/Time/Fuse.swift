/// Defines the behavior of a timed event, known as a "fuse", scheduled to occur
/// after a specific number of game turns.
///
/// Fuses are classic ZIL features used to implement delayed actions or events.
/// For example, a fuse might be lit on a stick of dynamite, causing an explosion
/// after a set number of turns, or a magical spell might wear off after a duration.
///
/// You create `Fuse` instances (which act as definitions) and register them with the
/// `DefinitionRegistry` when setting up your game (typically in `GameBlueprint`).
/// To start a timed event, you would then use a game command or side effect to activate
/// the fuse by its ID, at which point the `GameEngine` begins tracking its `initialTurns`.
/// When the turn counter for an active fuse reaches zero, its `action` is executed.
