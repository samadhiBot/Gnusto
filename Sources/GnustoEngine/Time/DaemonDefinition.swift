/// NPC behaviors, or other processes that occur automatically without direct player
/// command. For example, a daemon might make an NPC wander, cause a light source
/// to gradually dim, or check if a certain game condition triggers a special event.
///
/// You create `DaemonDefinition` instances and register them with the
/// `TimeRegistry` when setting up your game (typically in `GameBlueprint`).

/// the appropriate turns based on their `frequency`.
