/// Represents an interactive object or entity within the game world, such as a brass lantern,
/// a rusty key, a treasure chest, or even a non-player character (NPC).
///
/// Each `Item` has a unique `id` (`ItemID`) and a collection of `properties` that define its
/// current state, characteristics, and behaviors (e.g., its name, description, location,
/// whether it's openable, takable, etc.).
///
/// Game developers define items by providing an `ItemID` and a list of initial
/// `ItemProperty`s. Many common properties (like `name`, `parent`, `adjectives`)
/// have convenience computed properties for easy access and modification through the `GameEngine`.
/// The raw state of all properties is stored in the `properties` dictionary using `PropertyID`
/// as keys.
///
/// Items are a fundamental part of the `GameState` and are manipulated by player commands
/// and game logic, often through `ActionHandler`s and `GameEngine` helper methods.

    ///
    /// Each key is a `PropertyID` (e.g., `.name`, `.description`, `.itemParent`) and the value
    /// is a `StateValue` wrapper containing the actual typed data for that property. While direct
    /// access is possible, game logic typically interacts with these properties via convenience
    /// accessors on `Item` (for reading) or through `GameEngine` methods (for modifications, which
    /// generate `StateChange`s).
    public var properties: [ItemPropertyID: StateValue]

    /// Creates a new `Item` instance with a given ID and initial properties.
    ///
    /// The `properties` parameter takes a variadic list of `ItemProperty` instances.
    /// `ItemProperty` is a helper enum that encapsulates both the `PropertyID` (the key)
    /// and the initial `StateValue` for a property.
    ///
    /// Example:
    /// ```swift
    /// let lantern = Item(
    ///     id: "brassLantern",
    ///     .name("brass lantern"),
    ///     .description("A tarnished brass lantern, surprisingly heavy."),
    ///     .synonyms(["lantern", "light"]),
    ///     .adjectives(["brass", "tarnished", "heavy"]),
    ///     .in(.livingRoom),
    ///     .isTakable,
    ///     .isDevice,
    ///     .isOn,
    ///     .size(10)
    /// )
    /// ```

    ///   - id: The item's unique `ItemID`.
    ///   - properties: A variadic list of `ItemProperty`s defining the item's initial state.

    /// and maintaining game state consistency.
