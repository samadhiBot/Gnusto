import Foundation

/// Represents a property of an `Item`, providing both descriptive attributes and behavioral flags.
///
/// `ItemProperty` serves as the foundation for defining item characteristics in the Gnusto engine.
/// Properties can be either value-based (strings, integers, complex types) or boolean flags that
/// control item behavior and interactions.
///
/// ## Usage
/// Properties are typically applied when creating items using a fluent syntax:
/// ```swift
/// let lamp = Item(
///     id: "lamp",
///     .name("brass lamp"),
///     .description("A shiny brass lamp with intricate engravings."),
///     .isTakable,
///     .isLightSource,
///     .isDevice
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## ZIL Heritage
/// Many properties correspond to classic ZIL (Zork Implementation Language) flags and attributes,
/// maintaining compatibility with traditional interactive fiction conventions while providing
/// modern Swift expressiveness.
