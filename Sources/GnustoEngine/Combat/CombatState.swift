/// Represents the current state of an active combat encounter in the interactive fiction engine.
///
/// `CombatState` is the central data structure that tracks information needed to manage
/// turn-based combat encounters. It maintains the participants, progression, equipment, and
/// any special conditions or modifiers that affect the combat.
///
/// ## Combat Flow Integration
///
/// The combat state is stored in the game's global state under `GlobalID.combatState` and is
/// managed by the `GameEngine`. When combat begins (either through player-initiated attacks
/// or enemy encounters), a new `CombatState` is created and stored. The state persists across
/// combat rounds until the encounter ends through victory, defeat, or escape.
///
/// ## Usage in Combat Systems
///
/// Combat systems conforming to the `CombatSystem` protocol receive the current `CombatState`
/// through `ActionContext` and use it to make combat decisions. The state can be modified
/// between rounds to track progression, change weapons, or apply temporary effects.
///
/// ## State Persistence
///
/// As a `Codable` type, `CombatState` can be serialized for save games, ensuring that
/// ongoing combat encounters persist across game sessions.
///
/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// // Starting combat with a troll using a sword
/// let combatState = CombatState(
///     enemyID: .troll,
///     roundCount: 0,
///     playerWeaponID: .sword,
///     combatModifiers: ["playerBerserk": true]
/// )
/// ```

    /// `CharacterAttributes` for health, damage, and combat behavior.

    /// combat begins. It increments after each complete round (player action + enemy response).

    /// Combat systems can use this for:
    /// - Applying time-based effects or escalating difficulty
    /// - Determining when certain special attacks or abilities become available
    /// - Implementing fatigue or endurance mechanics
    /// - Creating narrative descriptions that reflect the length of the battle
    ///

    /// - Number of rounds elapsed
    /// - Damage dealt and received
    /// - Critical hits and special combat events
    /// - Environmental factors and desperation
    ///
    /// Higher intensity affects:
    /// - **Damage multipliers**: More brutal strikes as fighters become desperate
    /// - **Critical hit chances**: Increased likelihood of devastating attacks
    /// - **Special event frequency**: More disarms, staggers, and tactical maneuvers
    /// - **Narrative tone**: Descriptions become more intense and visceral
    ///
    /// - Note: Intensity typically increases over time but can spike dramatically
    ///   from critical events like near-death experiences or weapon disarming.

    ///
    /// Player fatigue accumulates during prolonged combat and affects:
    /// - **Attack accuracy**: Tired fighters are less precise
    /// - **Damage output**: Exhaustion reduces striking power
    /// - **Defense capability**: Slower reactions to enemy attacks
    /// - **Special abilities**: Some advanced maneuvers require stamina
    ///
    /// Fatigue increases with:
    /// - Combat round duration
    /// - Damage taken (pain and blood loss)
    /// - Heavy weapon usage
    /// - Failed critical attempts

    /// - Note: Very high fatigue (>0.8) may trigger automatic flee attempts
    ///   or surrender conditions for intelligent combatants.
    public let playerFatigue: Double

    /// The current fatigue level of the enemy (0.0 to 1.0).
    ///
    /// Enemy fatigue follows similar mechanics to player fatigue but may have
    /// different thresholds and effects based on the enemy's attributes:
    /// - **Constitution**: Determines base fatigue resistance
    /// - **Bravery**: Affects when fatigue triggers flee/surrender behavior
    /// - **Intelligence**: Smart enemies may retreat before reaching exhaustion
    ///
    /// Enemy AI uses fatigue levels to make tactical decisions about continuing
    /// combat versus attempting escape or surrender.

    ///
    /// This tracks the enemy's active weapon for the combat encounter. Unlike player
    /// weapons which are explicitly equipped, enemy weapons are typically determined
    /// by their character definition and combat attributes.
    ///
    /// Enemy weapons affect:
    /// - **Damage calculations**: Different weapons have different base damage
    /// - **Combat reach**: Some weapons allow attacks from greater distance
    /// - **Special abilities**: Certain weapons enable unique combat maneuvers
    /// - **Disarmament**: Enemies can lose weapons during combat
    ///
    /// If `nil`, the enemy is fighting unarmed (claws, fists, natural weapons).
    ///
    /// - Note: Enemy weapons may change during combat due to disarmament,
    ///   weapon breaking, or tactical weapon switching.

    // MARK: - Combat Modifiers

    /// A dictionary of combat-specific state values and temporary modifiers.
    ///
    /// This flexible storage system allows combat encounters to track temporary conditions,
    /// special effects, and situational modifiers that affect combat behavior. Examples include:
    ///
    /// - **Status Effects**: `"poisoned"`, `"blessed"`, `"cursed"`, `"stunned"`
    /// - **Tactical States**: `"playerDefending"`, `"enemyFlanked"`, `"highGround"`
    /// - **Temporary Bonuses**: `"weaponEnchanted"`, `"berserkerRage"`, `"magicalShield"`
    /// - **Environmental**: `"fightingInDarkness"`, `"slipperyGround"`, `"narrowSpace"`
    ///
    /// Combat systems can read and modify these values to implement complex combat mechanics
    /// while maintaining state across rounds.
    ///
    /// ## Usage Examples
    /// ```swift
    /// // Check for a status effect
    /// if case .bool(true) = combatModifiers["poisoned"] {
    ///     // Apply poison damage
    /// }
    ///
