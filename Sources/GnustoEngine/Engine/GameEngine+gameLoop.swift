    ///    If input is `nil` (e.g., EOF) or explicitly "quit", `shouldQuit` is set, and the turn ends.
    /// 2. Parses the player's input string into a structured `Command` using the `parser`.
    /// 3. If parsing is successful:
    ///    a. If the command is to quit or `shouldQuit` is set, the turn ends.
    ///    b. Calls `execute(command:)` to process the command through event and action handlers.
    ///    c. If the command was a movement command (`.go`) to an unvisited room, or a command
    ///       that changed the light state (e.g., `.turnOn`, `.turnOff` a light source), it then
    ///       calls `describeCurrentLocation()`.
    /// 4. Advances game time by calling `tickClock()`, which processes active fuses and daemons.
    ///    If `tickClock()` sets `shouldQuit` (e.g., a fuse ends the game), the turn ends.
    /// 5. If parsing fails, reports the `ParseError` to the player via `report(parseError:)`.
