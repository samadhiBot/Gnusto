/// The main orchestrator for an interactive fiction game, responsible for managing
/// the game's state, running the primary game loop, and coordinating interactions
/// between the player (via an `IOHandler`), the command `Parser`, and the various
/// game logic handlers (`ActionHandler`, `ItemEventHandler`, `LocationEventHandler`).
///
/// As a Swift `actor`, `GameEngine` ensures thread-safe access to the mutable `gameState`
/// from concurrent contexts, which is crucial for modern Swift concurrency.
///
/// Game developers typically interact with the `GameEngine` instance provided
/// within custom game logic closures (like those in `GameBlueprint` or event handlers)
/// or within `ActionHandler` implementations. Through this instance, developers can:
/// - Query the current `GameState` (e.g., find items, check locations) using the
///   various accessor methods and properties available in `GameEngine` extensions
///   (e.g., `GameEngine+stateQuery.swift`, `GameEngine+playerQuery.swift`).
/// - Initiate changes to the `GameState` by creating `StateChange` objects (often via
///   factory methods in `GameEngine+changes.swift`) and then applying them,
///   or by using higher-level convenience mutation methods (e.g., in
///   `GameEngine+stateMutation.swift`).
/// - Trigger output to the player (usually by returning an `ActionResult` with a message).
