    /// This method can be called to advance game time by one turn. It performs the following actions:
    /// 1. **Turn Increment**: Increments the player's move counter to advance game time.
    /// 2. **Fuses**: Iterates through all `activeFuses` in `gameState`.
    ///    - Decrements the turn counter for each active fuse.
    ///    - If a fuse's counter reaches zero or less:
    ///        - Retrieves the corresponding `Fuse` from the `GameBlueprint`.
    ///        - Executes the fuse's `action` closure, passing the `GameEngine` instance.
    ///        - Removes the fuse from `activeFuses` in `gameState`.
    ///        - If the fuse's `repeats` flag is `true`, it reactivates the fuse by adding it
    ///          back to `activeFuses` with its `initialTurns` count.
    /// 3. **Daemons**: Iterates through all `activeDaemons` in `gameState`.
    ///    - Retrieves the corresponding `Daemon` from the `GameBlueprint`.
    ///    - Executes the daemon's `action` closure, passing the `GameEngine` instance.
    ///
    /// Fuse and daemon actions can modify game state, print messages (by returning an `ActionResult`
    /// that the engine then processes), or even set `shouldQuit` to end the game.
    /// Errors during fuse/daemon definition lookup or action execution are logged.
