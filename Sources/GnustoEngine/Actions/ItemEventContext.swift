/// Context object passed to item event handler functions containing the event, subject item, and engine.

/// the need for event handlers to manually retrieve the subject item.

/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// static let lampHandler = ItemEventHandler(for: .lamp) {
///     before(.turnOn) { context, command in
///         if await context.item.hasFlag(.isBroken) {
///             ActionResult("The lamp is broken and won't turn on.")
///         } else {
///             ActionResult(
///                 "The lamp flickers to life.",
///                 context.item.setFlag(.isOn)
///             )
///         }
