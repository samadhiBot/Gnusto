            Common commands:
            - LOOK or L - Look around your current location
            - EXAMINE <object> or X <object> - Look at something closely
            - TAKE <object> or GET <object> - Pick up an item
            - DROP <object> - Put down an item you're carrying
            - INVENTORY or I - See what you're carrying
            - GO <direction> or just <direction> - Move in a direction (N,
              S, E, W, etc.)
            - OPEN <object> - Open doors, containers, etc.
            - CLOSE <object> - Close doors, containers, etc.
            - PUT <object> IN <container> - Put something in a container
            - PUT <object> ON <surface> - Put something on a surface
            - SAVE - Save your game
            - RESTORE - Restore a saved game
            - QUIT - End the game

            You can use multiple objects with some commands (TAKE ALL, DROP
