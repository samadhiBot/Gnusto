## Act I: Get little Gnusto back into Berzio’s yard

769 GUE. You are a neighbor of a little-known thaumaturge named Berzio.

Like all of the nearby neighbors, you pack up some food about once a week, and drop it off at Berzio’s front door. It’s something that has been passed down since at least your grandmother’s childhood. In return, a pleasant aura of magic pervades your mile of the winding country road, keeping the hedges in check and the flowers in bloom, the shingles in place, and the shutters free from peeling paint. In your case, there’s even a magical stone bridge spanning the creek that runs between your house and the road.

On this day you leave your house with basket in hand, and in it a warm sourdough boule, a crock of fresh butter and a jar of cherry preserves. Your other hand grips a glass jug filled with freshly squeezed blackberry lemonade.

Crossing the stone bridge on your way out, you feel the stones wobble and bob slightly, and notice a few feeble sparks crackling between them. Berzio is known to go days without eating as he toils away in his basement laboratory, utterly engrossed in his thaumaturgical studies, and oblivious to anything else. The clattering stones beneath your feet are a telltale sign, and you’re glad you thought to pay him a visit this morning.

You walk down the lovely country road until you come to Berzio’s gate. With your hands quite full, you have to use your elbow to push down the latch and push your way in. But before you can take a step into Berzio’s garden, his little dog Gnusto slips out, dashing between your ankles and into the lane. Overjoyed to have company, she skitters about wriggling this way and that.

_Thus begins Act I: trying to get little Gnusto back into Berzio’s yard._

- Calling Gnusto, the parser gets in the way: “What do you want to gnusto?” Trying to address her using other words only confuses her.
- You’ll have to put down what you’re carrying and try to pick her up, but where to put down the food?
  - Trying to put down the basket, Gnusto thinks it’s for her and tries to take it.
  - Trying to put down the lemonade, Gnusto is sure to knock it over and spill it.
  - Solution:
    1. put the lemonade on your head
    2. put the basket down
    3. pick up Gnusto
    4. pick up the basket
    5. Walk through the gate

Now you’re in Berzio’s garden, and you can put Gnusto down. You won’t be able to do anything until you put Gnusto down (she’s licking your face enthusiastically)

Just then there’s a knock at the gate, and it’s an officer from the Frobozz Hat and Stole Company, Department of Animal and Minor Monster Control,

the Frobozz Animal Control Division, a wholly owned subsidiary of the. The Animals and Minor Monsters Gnusto is in violation of the
