        You are a neighbor of Berzio, a reclusive thaumaturge whose
        modest cottage sits just across the creek from your own. Like
        your grandmother before you, and her grandmother before that,
        you've kept up the old tradition--once a week, you pack up some
        food and carry it to his gate. It's a small kindness that goes
        back generations, one of those quiet customs that makes a
        community feel like home.

        In return, Berzio's gentle magic keeps your little corner of the
        world just as it should be. The hedges grow in perfect shapes
        without pruning, wildflowers bloom in endless abundance, and
        even the weather seems a touch more agreeable. Your own magical
        bridge--fitted stones that hover gracefully above the
        creek--stands as testament to his beneficent influence.

        Today you've prepared something special: a warm sourdough boule
        still fragrant from the oven, a crock of golden butter churned
        yesterday, and a jar of cherry preserves that gleam like rubies
        in the morning light. In your other hand, you carry a jug of
        freshly squeezed blackberry lemonade--the perfect refreshment for
        a thaumaturge who sometimes forgets to eat for days at a time.

        The morning is beautiful, your basket is full, and Berzio's
        bridge awaits. Time to pay your weekly visit to the most
        absent-minded neighbor in the countryside.
