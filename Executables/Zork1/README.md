# Zork 1: The Great Underground Empire - Gnusto Engine Replica

## Project Overview

This is a faithful recreation of the classic 1980 Infocom adventure game "Zork 1: The Great Underground Empire" using the modern Gnusto Interactive Fiction Engine. This project serves as both a research endeavor to understand the mechanics of classic interactive fiction and a demonstration of the Gnusto engine's capabilities in recreating authentic ZIL-based gaming experiences.

## Goals

### Primary Objectives

- **Faithful Player Experience**: Recreate the exact player-facing behavior, responses, and mechanics of the original Zork 1
- **Authentic Nostalgia**: Preserve the original text, phrases, and responses that made Zork 1 memorable (e.g., "It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.")
- **Modern Architecture**: Build upon clean, maintainable Swift 6 code following SOLID principles
- **Research Foundation**: Provide a reference implementation for studying classic interactive fiction mechanics

### Secondary Objectives

- **Engine Validation**: Demonstrate the Gnusto engine's ability to handle complex, feature-rich games
- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation of ZIL-to-Gnusto translation patterns
- **Testing Excellence**: Achieve 80-90% test coverage for all game mechanics
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as a learning tool for understanding both classic IF design and modern engine architecture

## Methodology

### Development Approach

1. **ZIL Reference-Driven Development**: Use the original ZIL source code as the primary specification
2. **Player-Experience First**: Prioritize authentic player-facing behavior over exact ZIL implementation details
3. **Modern Best Practices**: Apply Swift 6 concurrency, SOLID principles, and clean architecture
4. **Iterative Implementation**: Build incrementally, testing against the reference walkthrough at each stage

### Translation Philosophy

- **Honor Over Replicate**: Preserve the spirit and player effects of ZIL mechanics while using modern Swift patterns
- **Question Complexity**: When ZIL patterns seem overly complex, propose streamlined modern interpretations
- **Maintain Authenticity**: Keep all original text, responses, and nostalgic elements intact
- **Document Decisions**: Record all translation choices and rationale for future reference

## Reference Materials

### Primary Sources

- **`Zork 1.pdf`**: Complete walkthrough and reference guide for player-facing behavior
- **ZIL Source Code**: Original implementation files in `References/Zork 1/`
  - `1dungeon.zil`: World structure, locations, and items
  - `1actions.zil`: Action handlers and game mechanics
  - `gverbs.zil`: Verb definitions and synonyms
  - `gsyntax.zil`: Grammar patterns and parsing rules
  - `gparser.zil`: Parser implementation
  - `gglobals.zil`: Global variables and game state
  - `gclock.zil`: Time-based events and scheduling
  - `gmain.zil`: Main game loop and initialization

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Engine Documentation**: `Sources/GnustoEngine/Documentation.docc/` for architectural patterns
- **Action Pipeline**: All state changes must flow through `StateChange` objects
- **Blueprint Pattern**: Use `GameBlueprint` for static game definition
- **Testing Standards**: `Swift Testing` framework with comprehensive coverage

## Implementation Notes

### Key Mechanics to Implement

1. **Treasure System**: Score-based treasure collection
2. **Thief Character**: Complex NPC behavior and interactions
3. **Maze Navigation**: The infamous maze sections
4. **Light Sources**: Lamp, matches, and darkness mechanics
5. **Container Puzzles**: Trap doors, safes, and hidden compartments
6. **Combat System**: Fighting trolls, thieves, and other creatures
7. **Magic System**: Spells and magical interactions
8. **Inventory Management**: Size, weight, and carrying capacity
9. **Save/Restore**: Game state persistence
10. **Death and Resurrection**: Player death mechanics

### ZIL-to-Gnusto Translation Patterns

- **Rooms (OBJECT)** → `Location` entities
- **Objects (OBJECT)** → `Item` entities
- **Verbs (SYNTAX)** → `ActionHandler` implementations
- **Routines (ROUTINE)** → Swift functions/methods
- **Global Variables (GLOBAL)** → `GameState` properties
- **Daemons/Fuses (DAEMON/FUSE)** → `TimeRegistry` events
- **Properties (PUT/GET)** → Dynamic properties system

### Development Sessions Log

#### Session 1: Project Setup

- Created Zork 1 executable structure
- Established README.md with goals and methodology
- Set up reference materials and documentation

#### Future Sessions

- [ ] Initial game blueprint and world structure
- [ ] Core location and item definitions
- [ ] Basic movement and interaction system
- [ ] Inventory and examination mechanics
- [ ] Light and darkness implementation
- [ ] Treasure system and scoring
- [ ] NPC behavior (especially the thief)
- [ ] Combat mechanics
- [ ] Advanced puzzles and special cases
- [ ] Save/restore functionality
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and validation

## Testing Strategy

### Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Individual game mechanics and systems
- **Integration Tests**: Complex interactions and puzzle solutions
- **Regression Tests**: Verification against the reference walkthrough
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and error handling

### Validation Approach

- Compare outputs against `Zork1.rtf` walkthrough
- Test all documented commands and responses
- Verify scoring system accuracy
- Confirm puzzle solution sequences
- Validate NPC behavior patterns
