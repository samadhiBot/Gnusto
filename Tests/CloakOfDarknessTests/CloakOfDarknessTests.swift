            Cloak of Darkness

            A basic IF demonstration.

            Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to
            see the bright lights of the Opera House. It's surprising that
            there aren't more people about but, hey, what do you expect in
            a cheap demo game...?

            --- Foyer of the Opera House ---

            You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in
            red and gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead. The
            entrance from the street is to the north, and there are
            doorways south and west.

            > inventory
            You are carrying:
            - A velvet cloak

            > examine the cloak
            A handsome cloak, of velvet trimmed with satin, and slightly
            spattered with raindrops. Its blackness is so deep that it
            almost seems to suck light from the room.

            > drop it
            This isn't the best place to leave a smart cloak lying around.

            > go south
            Darkness rushes in like a living thing.

            This is the kind of dark that swallows shapes and edges,
            leaving only breath and heartbeat to prove you exist.

            > walk north
            --- Foyer of the Opera House ---

            > go north
            You've only just arrived, and besides, the weather outside
            seems to be getting worse.

            > go west
            --- Cloakroom ---

            The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with
            hooks, though now only one remains. The exit is a door to the
            east.

            > examine the brass hook
            It's just a small brass hook, screwed to the wall.

            > remove the cloak
            You remove the velvet cloak.

            > hang it on the brass hook
            You successfully hang the velvet cloak on the small brass hook.

            > examine the hook
            It's just a small brass hook, with a cloak hanging on it.

            > walk east
            --- Foyer of the Opera House ---

            > go south
            --- Bar ---

            The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the
            opulence of the foyer to the north, is completely empty. There
            seems to be some sort of message scrawled in the sawdust on the
            floor.

            > read the message
            The message, neatly marked in the sawdust, reads...
