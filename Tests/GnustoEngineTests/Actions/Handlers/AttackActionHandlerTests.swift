            The angry beast's defenses crumble! He stands exposed, unable
            to protect himself.

            The angry monster strikes back with his axe but you've already

            whispers against skin, leaving a thin signature of pain. The

            of pain, but his body absorbs it. He remains dangerous.

            The beast's counter with his axe misses completely, the weapon
            whistling through empty space.

            > attack the troll
            You land the decisive hit! The fearsome beast wavers for a
            heartbeat, then collapses into permanent silence.

            A laboratory in which strange experiments are being conducted.

            There is an evil monster here.

            Despite having no weapon, the evil monster charges with
            terrifying resolve! You grip your sharp dagger tighter, knowing
            you'd better use this advantage.

            > attack the monster with my dagger
            Your strike with your sharp dagger grazes the evil monster,
            drawing minimal blood. It registers the wound with annoyance.

            The evil monster's counter-punch goes wide, rage making the
            strike clumsy and predictable.

            Armed and hungry for violence, you strike with your sharp
            dagger as the evil monster can only dodge and weave against the
            advantage of sharpened metal.

            The evil monster nimbly dodges and twists away from your sharp
            dagger, using speed to compensate for being unarmed.

            The evil monster's counter-strike punches through air, missing
            by the width of good instincts.

            > stab the monster
            You nick the evil monster with your sharp dagger, the weapon
            barely breaking skin. It notes the minor damage and dismisses
            it.

            In the tangle, the evil monster drives an elbow home -- sudden
            pressure that blooms into dull pain. The cut registers dimly.
            Blood, but not enough to matter.

            > stab the monster
            Your sharp dagger swings wide, and the evil monster avoids your
            poorly aimed strike with ease.

            The evil monster pivots and strikes true -- impact ripples
            through muscle and bone, stealing balance and breath together.
            You absorb the hit, feeling flesh tear but knowing you can
            endure.
