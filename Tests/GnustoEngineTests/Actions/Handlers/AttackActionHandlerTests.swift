            Armed and hungry for violence, you strike with your sharp
            dagger as the evil monster can only dodge and weave against the
            advantage of sharpened metal.

            Your strike with your sharp dagger grazes the evil monster,
            drawing minimal blood. The light wound barely seems to
            register.

            In the exchange, the evil monster lands clean. The world
            lurches as your body absorbs punishment it won't soon forget.
            The blow lands solidly, drawing blood. You feel the sting but
            remain strong.

            The evil monster's lightning-fast counter strikes your wrist,

            The evil monster retaliates with raw force that rocks you hard,
            leaving you stumbling through space that won't hold still.

            A laboratory in which strange experiments are being conducted.

            There is an evil monster here.

            Despite having no weapon, the evil monster charges with
            terrifying resolve! You grip your sharp dagger tighter, knowing
            you'd better use this advantage.

            > attack the monster with my dagger
            Your blow with your sharp dagger catches the evil monster
            cleanly, tearing flesh and drawing crimson. The blow lands
            solidly, drawing blood. It feels the sting but remains strong.

            In the tangle, the evil monster drives an elbow home--sudden
            pressure that blooms into dull pain. The wound is trivial
            against your battle fury.
