            ────────────────────────
            You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red
            and gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from
            the street is to the north, and there are doorways south and west.

              A velvet cloak

            Cloakroom
            ─────────
            The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks,
            though now only one remains. The exit is a door to the east.
            You can see a small brass hook here.
            > examine brass hook
            It's just a small brass hook, screwed to the wall.
            > hang the cloak on the brass hook
            You put the velvet cloak on the small brass hook.
            > examine cloak
            A handsome cloak, of velvet trimmed with satin, and slightly
            spattered with raindrops. Its blackness is so deep that it
            almost seems to suck light from the room.
            > examine hook
            It's just a small brass hook, with a cloak hanging on it.

            of the foyer to the north, is completely empty. There seems to
            be some sort of message scrawled in the sawdust on the floor.
            You can see a scrawled message here.

            "You win."
