            Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of
            the walls here. He does not speak, but it is clear from his
            aspect that the bag will be taken only over his dead body.

            > stab the thief with my sword
            You explode into motion with your blade hunting flesh as the
            person meets your charge with his stiletto, the dance of death
            begun.

            The impact sends the man reeling! He clutches his knife
            desperately while fighting to stay upright.

            Suddenly the shady robber slips past your guard. His blade
            opens a wound that will mark you, and your blood flows out
            steady and sure. First blood to them. The wound is real but
            manageable.

            > slay the thief
            Your armed advantage proves decisive--your antique glamdring
            ends it! The robber crumples, having fought barehanded and
            lost.

            Almost as soon as the thief breathes his last breath, a cloud
            of sinister black fog envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
            carcass has disappeared. His booty remains.
